#First Milestone Project - Herts Home Security

For my first milestone project I decided I wanted to make a website that meant something to me personally,
potentially something that I could use. Alongside my current employment and my studies, I run a small family
business with my two brothers. Our business is in the home security sector, supplying and installing CCTV,
intruder alarms, etc for homes and comercial properties. As we are a small company we only cover the county
of Hertfordshire. The aim of the website is to attract new customers, who can see our previous work and see
all the services we have to offer. Any potential customers can then get in touch with us directly by a number
of methods, be it through the enquiry form, or the many links to our contact details/social media pages.

When planning on how I wanted the website to look, I researched other home security websites. Most of which
covered the whole nation, as such have taken the approach of an urban feel with high rise city landscapes as
backgrounds and modern city centre style offices. This obviously attracts a different market to what we as a
company reach out to, we cover Hertfordshire which predominantey is known for it's countrysides and rural
lanscapes. For that reason, I wanted my website to look different from other home security websites but offer
the same features. I've gone for a less traditional header image of a rural landscape of Hertfordshire, and
used green and grey colours throughout the website as I believe they compliment each other well, with the green
tying in to the rural feel.

##UX and Features

The design of this website was built in mind for new potential customers, who are looking for CCTV,
intruder alarms, etc. to be installed to their properties. The website has a static header and footer that is
the same across all the pages, that way the essential links are always available. The header image/writing is a
link back to the home page, the footer has contact details taht includes a link to sending a direct email and
the social media links are always on the footer also. 

###Home

Once I had created the header and footer this was my framework for all pages. I felt that the home page didn't
'shout' out what the company, so that is why I decided to add an image of security products directly below the
header, followed by brief description of our business.

###Services

I decided the services page would suit being the next page along from 'Home', as customers will want to see what
services we have to offer. The layout and content of this page could be in much more detail and could have sub
pages coming from it, but due to time restrictions I went for a simpler approach. As we only offer a few services,
I wrote a brief description of each accompanied with an image of said service. Going forward I would like to
improve this page by having sub pages for each service to go into more detail of the different equipment we have
on offer for each service. I also added a link to our contact page so that if the customer was happy with what
they saw then they could go straight to getting in touch with us.

###Our work

Following on from the 'Services' page, I thought the 'Our Work' page next would be appropriate due to if customers
liked the look of the services we offer then they would like to see our previous work. As we are a new business and
haven't completed many jobs, I only had a few images to use. I decided to use a carousel to display the images
because that way the images can be large, as opposed to having multiple images displayed on one page. I had blank
white space either side of the carousel so I thought a good idea would be to display reviews from previous customers,
not only to fill the blank space but it linked in to the features of the page.

###Contact

The last page, quite traditionally is the 'Contact' page. My design before I set out to make the website always
involved having an enquiry form and a map of where we are located as a visual representation. The enquiry form
involves the customer inputting their email address, a section to select what service they require and a text box
for them to write any additional information they wish to add. Prior to creating this page I knew how to create a
form and I presumed it would be easy to link the submit button to our business email address. Unfortunately, upon
researching on how to achieve this, it seems to involve JavaScript and learning quite a lot of this language. Going
forward I would like to make the submit button send an email to the company email address with the information from
the enquiry form.

##Acknowledgements 

* I received inspiration for this project from the Code Institute tutorial videos. I liked the idea of
having the Header and Footer the same for each webpage, taught on the videos. Linking to the footer element,
again, inspiration fromt the tutorial videos on the layout and sectioning of the footer which I really liked 
the desogn of and thought would suit my website.
* I researched local competitors for inspiration on content/layout from: https://www.shebangsecurity.co.uk/
